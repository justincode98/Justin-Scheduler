# Justin Moment.js Legacy Code 
This project is based off code found here: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/super-disco  
The code will create a simple calendar app that allows the user to save text at any hour of the day.
Additionally, this project will use Bootstrap, Moment.js, and Jquery


## Installation
Download the code and run index.html with a web browser. 
This code was tested in Google Chrome.  

Alternatively it can be found live here: https://justincode98.github.io/Justin-Scheduler/

## Usage
After running index.html, the browser should show a simple calendar app that displays the current date at the top of the page.  
The user is then able to scroll down to view time blocks for standard business hours. These time blocks can be clicked and edited, and the texts will persist through local storage  
The time blocks are color coded.  
Past: Grey  
Present: Red  
Future: Green  

## Known Issues
Local Storage unimplemented  
Styling  
Button functionality  
Code needs additional refactoring for readability
